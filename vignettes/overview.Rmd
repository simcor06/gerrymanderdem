## 4.1 Summary
The object of this project is to use 2010 census tract level demographic data in conjunction with federal, state upper house, and state lower house precincts boundaries to better understand the demographic makeup of each of these political areas. This will be used to assist in better understanding the relationship between gerrymandering and demography in the US.  We will initially perform this analysis on the US state of Wisconsin to test out the process, and then perform it on another state (most likely North Carolina).  The demographic data we are interested in examining are total population and ethnic composition, but we may also examine age, income, and other interesting demographic aspects. After we have conducted the analysis on these two states, and created summary statistics and maps that allow users to better understand the demographic makeup of political districts in each state, we will outline how the process was done and how it can be applied to other states.  One of the largest challenges within this project is the collection of state legislative district boundaries and spatial data. There is no current complete database of state legislative districts, and therefore data is organized in different manners based on the platform that the individual state uses to distribute such data. Therefore, it will be a challenge to make a “one-size” fits all package mainly due to the uploading, cleaning, and organizing process.

## 4.2 Approach and Method


### 4.2.1 Data
-Census Tract level demographic data and shapefiles
-

### 4.2.2 Code
-Load census tract Shapefiles and join with census tract demographic data (Andrea Huerfano)
-Load congressional, state upper, and state lower district boundaries (Cory Hertog)
-

### 4.2.3  Timelines
- 11/27/2017 - Have Wisconsin polygons intersected
- 11/29/2017 - create area ratios and demographic number for polictical districts
- 12/4/2017 - Finish demographic data displays of wisconsin polictial districts, begin work on second state
- 12/8/2017 - Finish data dispalys
- 12/11/2017 - Class presentation
-Create general outlien of how to proceed nationally for  this
